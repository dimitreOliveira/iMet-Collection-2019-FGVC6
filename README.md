### Overview

The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, also known as The Met, has a diverse collection of over 1.5M objects of which over 200K have been digitized with imagery. The online cataloguing information is generated by Subject Matter Experts (SME) and includes a wide range of data. These include, but are not limited to: multiple object classifications, artist, title, period, date, medium, culture, size, provenance, geographic location, and other related museum objects within The Met’s collection. While the SME-generated annotations describe the object from an art history perspective, they can also be indirect in describing finer-grained attributes from the museum-goer’s understanding. Adding fine-grained attributes to aid in the visual understanding of the museum objects will enable the ability to search for visually related objects.
